## Phase-2-Project-Grumble
For my second project, I created a music website called Grumble. Grumble is intended to be a website were the user could add information about any music album that they choose. The user adds the ablum's name, the artist/band, the genre of the album, and a URL image of the album. Grumble will then create a unique card using this information so that the user can like or dislike the album. The user can also filter through the different cards based on genre and delete a card if necessary.
